 ChangeLog
 ---------
 0.13
     - remove the expect and match mechanism. They didn't work very
	  well, and a future implementation should be done as a
       independent library. If someone missed this functions, please
       let me know.

 0.12
     - more documentation for doxygen
	- replace the ugly GetSettingsAsString methods by a more intuitive
	  one.
     - wxGPIB::Read now checks the MAV bit before reading. This resolves
	  some stderr stuff on linux.

 0.11
     - the gpib sources are no longer depending on the OS. They are
	  identical for linux and windows.  
	- add the current version to the ctb include path, so you can
	  handle a parallel installation of different versions.
	  For instance: The header path wx/ctb is replaced by wx/ctb-0.11

 0.10
     - replace the former gpib async io access with the standard
	  NI-488 functions (ibrd,ibwrt). To avoid blocking, the internal
	  gpib timeout was set to the lowest value, whereas the wxIOBase
	  methods handles the timeout in a global and transparent manner.
	- add a FindListener method in the wxGPIB class to look for all
	  connected gpib devices (listeners).
     - The Read and Readv method of the python wxIOBase class returns
	  additional zero bytes, fixed. 

 0.9
	- added python support for both, serial and gpib 

 0.8
     - added bakefile support
	 
 0.7 
     - added GPIB (Nation Instruments GPIB cards) support
